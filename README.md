# Parser Combinators tutorial
This is where I save the XML parser I got from Bodil Stokke's tutorial on parser combinators from his website, [bodil.lol](https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/). His tutorial was licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).  
You can find in `src/lib.rs` a compilation of snippets found on this tutorial, sometimes slightly modified with shortcuts added to traits.  

Bodil, if you see this, thank you very much for your work.
